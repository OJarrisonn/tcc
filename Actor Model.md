# Actor Model

The actor model is a model for concurrent computation where a program is though
in terms of **actors** that work independently of each other and communicate via
messages.

When hit with a message an actor can do a lot of things, like:

- Define the behaviour of next messages
- Create new actors
- Send messages to other actors

The actor model can be think of as a concurrent safe OOP.
