Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses objects as its main abstraction. Some of the core features of object-oriented programming languages (OOPL) are:
- **Inheritance**: objects might inherit properties from other objects in a parental relationship
- **Encapsulation**: objects might encapsulate logic in the form of operations
- **Polymorphism**: capacity of
- **Message passing**: objects send each other messages and each object determines how to handle the received message (or even do not handle it at all)
